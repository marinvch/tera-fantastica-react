# Prompt Quality Pack — tera-fantastica-react

> Stack: **React (Vite)** · Language: **TypeScript** · Package manager: **npm**

## 1. Prompt Template

Use this structure for best results:

```
Goal: <one sentence — what should be accomplished>
Scope: #file:<path> or describe the affected area
Constraints: <framework rules, must-nots, or size limits>
Agent: <agent name if a specialist is needed>
Skill: <skill keyword if domain-specific guidance is needed>
Done-when: <acceptance criteria — how will we know it worked?>
```

## 2. Agent Routing Table

Use `@<agent-name>` to invoke a specialist agent:

| Agent | Description | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `Codebase Explorer` | Read-only navigator for tera-fantastica-react — answers "how does X work?" questions. | Ask about any feature, file, or pattern (e.g. "how does auth work?") |
| `Expert React (Vite) Developer` | Expert React (Vite) developer specializing in TypeScript patterns for tera-fantastica-react. | Describe the feature, bug or refactor you need help with |
| `tera-fantastica-react — Feature Enhancement Advisor` | Scan tera-fantastica-react for improvement opportunities and expansion ideas. Use when you want prioritized enhancements, gap analysis, roadmap proposals, and concrete implementation recommendations for this repository only. | Describe scope (e.g. reliability, DX, CI/CD, security, performance) and depth (quick/medium/deep). |
| `tera-fantastica-react — Idea Validator` | Validates enhancement recommendations from the Feature Enhancement Advisor against actual codebase reality. Use after the Enhancement Advisor produces a report — before any implementation begins. | Paste the Enhancement Advisor numbered report here, or describe the finding(s) to validate. |
| `tera-fantastica-react — Implementation Agent` | Executes the Approved Work Order produced by the Idea Validator. Implements changes in dependency-safe sequence. Use only after the Idea Validator has produced a verified Approved Work Order. | Paste the Approved Work Order from the Idea Validator, or name a specific item to implement. |
| `tera-fantastica-react Initializer` | Maintain and evolve the AI framework artifacts for the tera-fantastica-react repo (docs, skills, prompts) using the real React (Vite) stack. | What artifact to update or create (e.g. "update skills", "add agent for auth") |

## 3. Skill Trigger Keywords

Skills load automatically when your prompt matches their description:

| Skill | Trigger phrase / description |
|---|---|
| `ai-os-react-patterns` |  |

## 4. MCP Health Check

Verify the MCP server is connected before starting a session.
If `get_session_context` or `get_repo_memory` returns no output, the server is not running.
Restart it via the VS Code MCP panel or re-run the install.

## 5. Plan-Mode Trigger

Switch to **Plan mode** first when:
- The task has 3 or more sequential steps
- The change is irreversible (delete, drop, migrate, deploy)
- Multiple files or systems are affected

## 6. Post-Change Context Refresh

After structural changes (new dependencies, new files, architecture moves), refresh AI OS context:

```bash
npx -y github:marinvch/ai-os --refresh-existing
```

## 7. Anti-Patterns

- **Mixing concerns** — one prompt should do one thing
- **Vague `#codebase`** when a specific file path is known — use `#file:<path>`
- **Accepting unsourced claims** — verify with `get_repo_memory` or `search_codebase`
- **Skipping Plan mode** for irreversible changes
- **Ignoring stale context** — run `check_for_updates` if output quality drops

## Build & Test Commands

| Action | Command |
